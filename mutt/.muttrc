# * The following macros allow for quickly and easily adjusting the
#   pager_index_lines values.
# * By pressing <Esc> followed by a single digit number the pager_index_lines
#   can be increased or decreased to cause the current message to take up more
#   or less screen real estate (i.e. show more or less context in relation to
#   the other messages).
# * Just to reiterate if it wasn't caught in the previous point, \e corresponds
#   to the <Esc> key. Thus \e0 corresponds to pressing <Esc> followed by the 1
#   key (NOT SIMULTANEOUS KEY PRESSES).
